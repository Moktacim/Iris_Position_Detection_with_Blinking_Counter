#Iris_Position_Detection_with_Blinking_Counter

A project that utilizes iris detection to track eye movement and blinking, along with a blinking counter functionality.

### Overview
MediaPipe, released by Google in August 2020, is a machine learning model for detecting keypoints in a personâ€™s eye. It can be used to recognize where you are looking, estimate distance based on eye size, detect if you are sleeping, etc.

### Features
- Real-time iris detection for tracking eye movement.
- Blinking counter to count the number of blinks detected.
- Interactive visual interface to display iris position and blinking count.
